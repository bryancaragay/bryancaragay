# Hi there I'm Bryan👋

### 🤠 About Me
I'm a software developer with a passion for entrepreneurship. I've started (and failed) multiple companies, won $16,250 in pitch compeitions, designed my own apps from start to finish, and developed those apps to production on the app store.
Some of the app spaces i've worked in:
- Campus safety
- Fitness
- B2B communication

Overall, I have a passion for making software that people love. Implementation and details are important to me, but the end experience for the customer is what I think is the most important aspect of any software.
